            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1-4/1-2 cup water</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
            <li> Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
            <li> Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs.</li>
            <li>Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
            <li> Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions.</li>
            <li>  Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). Add the cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
            <li> Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
