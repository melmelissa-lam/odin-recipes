    <h3>General Description and History</h3>
    <p>Kimchi pancake or Kimchi Jeon (김치전) is a Korean savory pancake made with kimchi.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound well fermented napa cabbage kimchi chopped into small pieces with 2 tablespoon of the brine </li>
        <li>3 scallion chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>   
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the kimchi, kimchi brine, scallions, sugar, flour, and water in a medium bowl and mix well with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or a spatula to make a large circle.</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip it one more time and cook for another minute.</li>
